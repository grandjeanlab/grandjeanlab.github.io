I'm excited to be a [participating laboratory](https://www.badaward.nl/research-groups) for the [Bio-Art-Design award](https://www.badaward.nl/) 2020 scheme of the Medical Research Council [ZonMW](https://www.zonmw.nl/en/).

I'm happy to [discuss](mailto://joanes.grandjean@radboudumc.nl) collaborative art projects on the themes of brain science, body imaging, open science, or artificial intelligence, and more.
