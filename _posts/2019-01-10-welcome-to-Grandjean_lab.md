Welcome to the Preclinical Neuroimaging lab of the Radboud University Medical Center. Our [goals]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/about.html) is to develop neuroimaging technologies for animal models of brain disorders to highlight disease mechanisms and to test novel therapeutic approaches.

We seek to develop talents in a broad range of neuroscience. For that we [seek]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/contact.html) students with all ranges of interests, including physiology, data analysis, statistics, open science, animal behavior. The current on-going projects are detailed [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/projects.html). We continually seek to develop new collaborations.

See the present and past [members]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/members.html) of the group.
